#+title: Ox-Zola

=ox-zola= is an Org exporter backend for Zola-compatible Markdown. It
generates both the markdown body and the TOML frontmatter.

---

=ox-zola= is just a fork of the famous =ox-hugo= exporter.
All the stuff you can do with =ox-hugo= are possible in =ox-zola=.
I changed the name mostly to make the exporter easier to find for Zola users.

Go read the =ox-hugo= documentation to read about it:

* Installation
This package requires at least GNU Emacs *26.3* and
Org Mode *9.0*.
It's not available on Melpa, because it's not ready and I made it for
my personal use.

You can easily install it with =use-package= or with =package!= macro,
if you're on Doom Emacs, like me.

* Features
- [X] Custom frontmatters parameters for Zola
- [X] Lastmod/updated tags for Zola
- [X] Taxonomies for Zola
- [ ] Exports with images in the same directories
